# Snake Game


This is a classic Snake Game built with Python and Turtle.

## Getting Started


To get started with the game, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Playing the Game


To play the game, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
# This is a bash code block
git clone https://github.com/chriss1525/Snake_Game.git
```


Then, navigate to the cloned repository and run the following command:

```bash
# This is css code block
python game.py
```


Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake's body. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.
